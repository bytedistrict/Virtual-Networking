## Setting Up Resource Group

### Step 1

From the dashboard we can search for resource groups in the search bar. Click on Resource groups to create 

- Azure requires that you set up a resource group before you can set up anything else.
- Use the Azure portal to create a resource group that will contain everything the development team needs.

  1. Create name of your resource group and choose a region. 
  2. Every resource you create after this must be created in the same region.
  
  **Note:** When creating a resource group it is best practice to keep note of what region your group is in. This group's region is the East US, so I put EUS at the end of the resource group name (Exmple-Resourcegroup-EUS) for myself or whoever else is managing the server knows the region.
