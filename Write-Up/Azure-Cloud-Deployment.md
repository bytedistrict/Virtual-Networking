1. Create name of your resource group and choose a region. 
2. Every resource you create after this must be created in the same region.
3. Click on **Review + create**
  
**Note:** When creating a resource group it is best practice to keep note of what region your group is in. This group's region is the East US, so I put EUS at the end of the resource group name (Exmple-Resourcegroup-EUS) for myself or whoever else is managing the server knows the region.

 - Azure will let you know if there are any errors. Click on **Create** to finalize your settings and create the group

  ## Setting up the VNet
  
  ### Before you can deploy servers and services, there must be a network where these items can be accessed. 
  
  #### It is important to make sure the network has any resources the group will need now and in the future.
